# ElegooCar

Software for my ELEGOO Smart Robot Car Kit V3.0 and V4.0

The idea of the project is to have an object-oriented solution to control the car, and to have all features in one implementation.

| Feature | Car Version | Status |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Bluetooth remote controlled | V3.0 only | Implemented |
| Infrared remote controlled | V3.0, V4.0 | Implemented |
| Switching driving algorithm via bluetooth remote control | V3.0 only | Implemented |
| Switching driving algorithm via mode switch button | V4.0 | Implemented. Toggling through available drivers. |
| RGB LED shows selected driving algorithm | V4.0 | Implemented |
| Manual mode 1 (Manual-1), brakes on obstacles | V3.0, V4.0 | Implemented. Only moves a short distance at a time
| Manual mode 2 (Manual-2), brakes on obstacles | V3.0, V4.0 | Implemented. Keeps on moving until it gets stopped
| Automatic mode 1 (Auto-1), continuous driving with obstacle avoidance | V3.0, V4.0 | Implemented. Has trouble recognizing soft obstacles, smaller obstacles, and walls if approached in angles < 45 degrees or > 135 degrees |
| Automatic mode 2 (Auto-2), interrupted driving with rescan of environment | V3.0, V4.0 | Implemented. Has trouble recognizing soft obstacles, smaller obstacles, and walls if approached in angles < 45 degrees or > 135 degrees |
| Line tracking support | V3.0, V4.0 | Planned |
| More hardware suppport (MPU6050, WIFI Control) | V4.0 | Planned |

## The Car

## IDE

Developing using the Sloeber IDE (for Windows) "Download 64 bits Bundle" from http://eclipse.baeyens.it/stable.php?OS=Windows

## Libraries

Using following libraries:

| Library | Version | Location |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Servo | 1.1.7 | https://www.arduinolibraries.info/libraries/servo |
| IRremote | 2.2.3 | http://www.arduinolibraries.info/libraries/i-rremote |
| FastLED | 3.3.0 | https://www.arduinolibraries.info/libraries/fast-led |


## Verify and Upload using the Arduino IDE

This software can also be used in combination with the regular Arduino IDE, as documented below:

| Step | Details |
| :--- | :--- |
| Download and install the Arduino IDE | Download from  https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Software and follow the provided instructions |
| Download and unpack the ElegooCarV3 package | Download https://github.com/pieterbl/ElegooCarV3/archive/master.zip and unpack in your Arduino sketches directory, so that you have a directory ElegooCarV3 with the files ElegooCarV3.ino and the remaining files in it |
| Download and install the latest IRremote library version | Follow the **Installation** instructions here https://github.com/z3t0/Arduino-IRremote/blob/master/README.md and make sure to follow the instructions regarding the RobotIRremote  library. Download of version 2.2.3 is accessible here, too http://www.arduinolibraries.info/libraries/i-rremote  |
| Restart the Arduino IDE and open ElegooCarV3.ino | Check and modify the **CAR_VERSION** in ElegooCarV3.ino. Make sure your car is connected with your computer. Press verify to verify the software,  press upload to upload the software to the car |
| Download and configure the bluetooth app | Download the bluetooth  app from the below given locations. Configure the bluetooth app as described below |
| Drive the car  | Have fun and enjoy it |



# Driving the Car

This is how driving the car looks like https://github.com/pieterbl/ElegooCarV3/blob/master/ElegooCarV3.ino

## Driving with Bluetooth

The bluetooth app can be found at the below listed locations:

| Provider | Location |
| :--- | :--- |
| Google, Andriod | https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.femtoapp.rootsence.bleutils |
| Apple, iPhone | https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/elegoo-ble-tool/id1195318538 |

The bluetooth app must be configured in the following way:

| Left Column | Middle Column | Right Column |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Half Left (\\)  | Forward (F) | Half Right (/) |
| Left (L)  | Stop (S) | Right (R) |
| Manual-1 (M) | Backward (B) | Auto-1 (1) |
| Manual-2 (N)  | _empty_  | Auto-2 (2)  |

## Driving with Infrared

The Car is shipped with a infrared control.

| Key | Action |
| :--- | :--- |
| Arrow Up | drive forward |
| Arrow Down | drive backward |
| Arrow Left | rotate left |
| Arrow Right | rotate right |
| * | switch to next driving mode |

# Trouble Shooting

## avrdude: stk500_getsync() attempt 10 of 10: not in sync: resp=0x00

Lots of articles on this in the Internet. For me, it means the bluetooth receiver must be removed from the car. It is preventing the upload of a new program version to the Arduino.

```
